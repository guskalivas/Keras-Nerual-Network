# Keras-Nerual-Network
An introduction to Tensorflow and Keras Nerual Networks

Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) fashion dataset, utilized TF tools to build, and train a model to accurately predict an images label (class). The model utilizes an Adam optimizer, SparseCategoricalCrossentropy to calculate loss, accuracy as a metric and a ReLu activation.
